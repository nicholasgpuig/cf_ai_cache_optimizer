I want to create an edge-hosted AI assistant that ingests Cloudflare access logs (or synthetic logs), analyzes traffic patterns, recommends cache policy and routing improvements (and optionally generates deployable Worker/Cache rules), and explains the reasoning in natural language. Create a detailed implementation plan to build this project using Cloudflare Workers, Cloudflare Pages, Workers AI, and Durable Objects on the Cloudflare Developers platform.

In App.tsx, create a simple file upload interface, including a single button UI element to upload the log files in batch.

List the steps to create a binding for my Workers that will make them accessible to my Pages app in the same repository. Create code snippets in Typescript, too.
